## Task Manager
- React Native App to manage tasks. Mainly through the Expo module.

### Technologies:
- React Native
- Javascript
- Git
- Node.js
- Watchman
- Yarn

## Current Links:
- https://reactnative.dev/docs/virtualizedlist (To create dynamic task creations)
- https://reactnavigation.org/docs/params
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54317501/setinterval-not-clearing-properly-in-react-js-when-dealing-with-react-youtube-pa

## Current Problems:
- Fix long loading times, stated since upgrade performed.
### Calculator App (Future Work)
- Look into changing TouchableOpacity to pressable (https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable)
- Add a del/back button (<-)
- Add more complicated functions, like SQRT
- Make it so it displays division symbol while it input "/" into the calculator.
- No automatic adding operation just adds number to currently displayed one. (Maybe not even a problem.)
### Task App
- Change task background
- Make task adding dynamic, generalize task creation into function and specify the repetitions.
- Add memory to app, to remember task progress
### Platformer
- Change it into the zombie game where they randomly spawn and home to you. Shoot where you touch.
- Intervals not resetting, when initiated it stacks. Fix intervals to stop.
### Music Player (Future Work)
- Audio Link (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/audio/)
- Play song in background, record audio
