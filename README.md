## Task Manager
- React Native App to manage tasks. Mainly through the Expo module.

### Technologies:
- React Native
- Javascript
- Git
- Node.js
- Watchman
- Yarn

## Current Links:
- https://reactnative.dev/docs/virtualizedlist (To create dynamic task creations)
- https://reactnavigation.org/docs/params
- https://www.reactnativeschool.com/building-an-ios-calculator-clone-with-react-native (Ongoing: "Styling Text in React Native" complete)

## Current Problems:
### Calculator App
- Improve button formatting
- Look into changing TouchableOpacity to pressable (https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable)
- Add a del/back button (<-)
- No adding operation just adds number to currently displayed one. (Maybe not even a problem.)
### Task App
- Change task background
- Make task adding dynamic, generalize task creation into function and specify the repetitions.
- Add memory to app, to remember task progress
